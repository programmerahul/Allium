  we have implemented an Onion Storage mon-
itoring and controlling system based on IoT and Fuzzy Logic.
Based on the performance of the system after implementation,
it can be concluded that this system can monitor the onion
storage in real-time and effective to increase shelf life of onion.
Also, website helps the farmer to assess the conditions more
efficiently. Moreover, this made system could also predict the
shelf life of onions which far out-perform the conventional
system
